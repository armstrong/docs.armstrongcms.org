30 Second Tour of Armstrong
===========================

Armstrong is an open-source News Publishing Platform built on top of Django.
90% of all media websites are the same.  Armstrong gives you that first 90%
and lets you focus on the parts of your organization that make you unique.

Armstrong provides a lot of CMS bits, but its main focus is developer-
friendliness.  It works great as a replacement for other CMS/bloggy-type
systems when you have a tech team or consultant that can help get you
off the ground.

Want to see it in action?  Here's the commands to run:

::

    pip install armstrong
    armstrong init --template=demo demo-site
    cd demo-site
    armstrong runserver

Armstrong is the result of a collaboration between the `Texas Tribune`_ and the
`Bay Citizen`_ and a grant from the `John S. and James L. Knight Foundation`_.
